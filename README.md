(For android only) 


## Created with React-native-cli

## Files and folders

I used a main container to manage all logic.
I created many components to set the views (header, map, select)
A folder to manage all Api requests.
A folder to set Constants.
A folder for Assets
And a __test__ folder

## Tests

I used a function to manage the match between cats and countries and get coordinates. This is the only function that i tested, handled errors and all variables and props imported, not hardcoded


## What would I do with more time?

I would create a main Layout to set styles to all app
Create a state manager like Redux or another
Check compatibility with another devices
